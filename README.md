# 📦 ComeThru — Next.js + TypeScript Starter Project

## 🚀 Getting Started with This Next.js + TypeScript Project

This guide will help you get the project up and running on your local machine — even if you're new to Git, TypeScript, or Next.js!

---

### ✅ 1. Install the Tools

Before starting, make sure the following tools are installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js (includes npm)](https://nodejs.org/) – install the **LTS version**
- [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- (Optional) [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) – easier Git GUI if you're new to terminal

---

### ✅ 2. Clone the Project

Open your terminal (or Git Bash), and navigate to the folder where you keep your projects (e.g., `source/repos`). Then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ricozama121803/ComeThru.git



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
